# Predictive Bankruptcies using Financial Ratios and Machine Learning

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting corporate bankruptcies.  The model utilizes financial statement data and key financial ratios as input features.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate bankruptcy prediction, ultimately improving loan risk assessment and portfolio management strategies.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add other libraries used here if necessary)

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key performance metrics of the trained model to the console, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Additionally, the script may generate visualizations such as:

* Plots illustrating the relationships between key financial ratios and bankruptcy.  (e.g., `ratio_analysis.png`)
* Charts showing the performance of the model (e.g., ROC curve, confusion matrix). (e.g., `model_performance.png`)

The specific output files generated may vary depending on the model and analysis performed.  Check the generated files in the project directory for the complete results.
